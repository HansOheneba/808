        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          808 is a community of creatives collaborating with each other and
          third-party stakeholders to introduce much needed variety and
          excitement to the global entertainment industry.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          808 started when founder – Theo – and his friends set out to organize
          the biggest and most exciting Halloween party in Ghana. Back in 2022,
          the entertainment landscape was dominated by club-based partying and
          bottle culture, all of which restricted social interaction and reduced
          the excitement and enthusiasm of Ghana nightlife.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          With the goal to change the landscape and social culture in Ghana,
          Theo gathered a collective of creatives and through grit and
          determination, his vision for Halloween in Ghana – Midnight Madness –
          came to fruition, gaining widespread recognition and setting off a
          chain of events that would lead to the brand’s growth and success to
          date.
